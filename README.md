npm run preview

# Or preview with host flag to make it accessible on your local network
npm run preview:prod
```

### Development Mode

Start the development server with hot module replacement (HMR):
```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev

# Start with bundle analysis
ANALYZE=true npm run dev
```

## üöÄ Deployment

### Vercel (Recommended)

1. Push your code to a GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket repository
